### Overview
Introducing an innovative web application, tentatively named "Tinder for Restaurants", which aims to solve the perennial issue of selecting a restaurant for dining out. The proposed platform enables users to swipe through an array of restaurants, either indicating their interest or disinterest through the "like" or "dislike" feature. This process simplifies the decision-making process for individuals, couples, or groups, eliminating the hassle of arriving at a consensus on a restaurant. The app's algorithm matches the preferred choices of the users, culminating in the selection of an ideal restaurant for the occasion.
